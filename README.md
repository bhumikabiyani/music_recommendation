- **Visual Representation**: Displays album covers and Spotify links for recommended songs.
- **Customization**: Users can specify the number of recommendations they want to receive.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Streamlit
- Spotipy (Python library for Spotify Web API)
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn (for TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity)
- NLTK (for natural language processing tasks)
